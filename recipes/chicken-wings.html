        <p>Coating air fryer sweet and sour chicken wings with a baking powder rub yields perfectly crispy, golden brown, and tender wings. They're just waiting to be sauced to your preference, and this time, it'll be sweet and sour sauce. Put out plenty of napkins because they are sticky.</p>

        <h4>Ingreditents</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <h4>Wings:</h4>
            <li> 1½ pounds chicken wings, tips discarded</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <h4>Sauce:</h4>
            <li>½ cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup pineapple juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>1 stalk green onion, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
            <ul>
            <h4>Directions</h4>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the air fryer basket with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cook wings: Pat chicken wings dry with a paper towel. Whisk together baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika in a small bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Place some of the chicken wings into the bag, seal the bag, and shake until wings are well coated. Shake off excess baking powder mixture and repeat with remaining wings until all wings are coated.</li>
            <li>Place chicken wings in the prepared air fryer basket and cook in the preheated air fryer for 22 to 23 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make sauce: Combine vinegar, pineapple juice, ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, Sriracha, and sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir well and bring to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer. Stir together cornstarch and water in a small bowl until well combined; pour into the saucepan and quickly whisk until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a little water.</li>
            <li>Increase the air fryer temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to cook wings until crispy and browned, about 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce into a large bowl and add cooked wings; toss to coat well. Garnish with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
